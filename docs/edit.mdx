# Edit your Website

Everything this you see on this page is editable. Just click anywhere and start typing (assuming you're in Dhub's editor, and not prevewing the template).

## **Format text**

To make your text bold, convert it into a heading, or add a link â€“ select text and use the formatting menu to apply format to your text.

## **Add images and other components**

To add an image, a callout, or any other component to your website type `/` to open the command menu and then pick the item you want to add.

## **Create a new page**

Every md file you see in the side nav represents a page on your website. To create a new page simply create a new file.&#x20;

When you're in the docs tab, the folder structure in the sidenav matches the left side navigation on your website.
