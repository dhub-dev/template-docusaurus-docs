# Deploy your website to the Web

You can deploy your website to the web free of charge to hosting providers such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

To make this process easier, we added a `Deploy to Vercel` button that will direct you straight to the new project creation flow, with the correct repository and project type already set up.

To open the Deploy to Vercel dialog click on the three dots in the top right corner of the screen, and then click the `Publish to the Web` button.
