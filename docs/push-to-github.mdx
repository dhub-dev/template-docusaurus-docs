# Push your Project to GitHub

With Dhub you own your source code. Dhub keeps the GitHub repo of your project in sync with with your GitHub repository.

Creating a new GitHub repo for a Dhub project is easy: just click the `Push to GitHub` button at the top right corner, and follow the prompts to autenticate and connect your Github account (if you haven't done that already).

When your GitHub connection is set up, enter simply enter the repository name and click the `Create new repository` button.
